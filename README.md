 Color plist checker on HTML
 Developer : Cyrus Lam
 
 Objective : 
 I find we have a problem to modify the colour in the list of RGB color codes array file , but we dont have any documentation for reference.
 In order to change a expected part of colour will make programmer crazy. So i need a simple tool to assist us to find the target color visually.

 This tools is local HTML coding project.
 User can select the file from HTML file IO class function.
 User can to text inside the textfield area , either you dont have any XML file.
 Then press phase button. will get a list of colour of each record showing in textfield area.
